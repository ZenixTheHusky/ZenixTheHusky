Let me introduce myself. I'm Peter <sub><sup>(Yep, that's me!)ðŸ˜Š</sup></sub>. I have graduated with a first class honors degree in Computer Science from Swansea University.

Automating tasks and systems is something I really enjoy doing. At work, I've written Ansible PlayBooks to automate setting up Jenkins Agents, and I've written a PowerShell script to fully automate the compilation and deployment of our projects.

At my current job, I've explored more Jenkins Pipelines and Docker containers, as well as Terraform, High Performance Computing, and AWS.

Lately, I've been deploying pipelines to replace Jenins' FreeStyle jobs across our Windows and Linux agents and creating Groovy shared libraries to use across the business units I support. I'm also currently looking into using AWS SNS and SQS to trigger Jenkins pipelines when certain code has been pushed.

I haven't used this GitHub account in a while, however, there should be some more commits coming soon as I have started a side project. Unfortunately, those repos are private :(

I'm hoping to re-start my journey into open-source programming~ 

See ya in your repos sometime!
