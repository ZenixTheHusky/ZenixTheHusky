Let me introduce myself. I'm Peter <sub><sup>(Yep, thats me!)</sup></sub>. I'm currently studying Computer Science @ Swansea University and I'm on year 4 out of 5. I've got two large projects coming up in my 4th and 5th years which are TBD but hopefully they'll pop up here as repos soon!

Once I finish my MSc, I'll be returning to the Science and Technology Facilities Council on a Graduate placement where I'll be rotating through different teams within the ISIS Computing Department.

See ya around!
